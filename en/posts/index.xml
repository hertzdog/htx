      <title>Everything as Code: How We Manage Our Company In One Monorepo

At Kasava, we&#39;ve embraced the concept of &#34;everything as code&#34; to streamline our operations and ensure consistency across our projects. This approach allows us to manage our entire company within a single monorepo, providing a unified source of truth for all our configurations, infrastructure, and applications.

**Why a Monorepo?**

A monorepo offers several advantages:

1. **Unified Configuration**: All our settings, from development environments to production, are stored in one place. This makes it easier to maintain consistency and reduces the risk of configuration drift.

2. **Simplified Dependency Management**: With all our code in one repository, managing dependencies becomes more straightforward. We can easily track which versions of libraries and tools are being used across different projects.

3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: A single repository fosters better collaboration among team members. Everyone has access to the same codebase, making it easier to share knowledge and work together on projects.

4. **Consistent Build and Deployment Processes**: By standardizing our build and deployment processes, we ensure that all our applications follow the same best practices. This leads to more reliable and predictable deployments.

**Our Monorepo Structure**

Our monorepo is organized into several key directories:

- **/config**: Contains all configuration files for various environments, including development, staging, and production.
- **/infrastructure**: Houses the infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts for provisioning and managing our cloud resources.
- **/apps**: Includes all our applications, both internal tools and customer-facing products.
- **/lib**: Stores reusable libraries and modules that can be shared across different projects.
- **/scripts**: Contains utility scripts for automating various tasks, such as data migrations and backups.

**Tools and Technologies**

To manage our monorepo effectively, we use a combination of tools and technologies:

- **Version Control**: Git is our primary version control system, and we use GitHub for hosting our repositories.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: We employ Jenkins for automating our build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform is our tool of choice for managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible is used for configuring and managing our servers and applications.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: We use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring,</title>
