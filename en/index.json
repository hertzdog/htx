Every day, you face challenges such as managing untyped inputs and outputs, the difficulty of debugging, and the lack of traceability of operations. In this scenario, every small error can lead to high costs and inaccurate results. Now, imagine having a tool that allows you to build, run, and verify these workflows reliably and transparently. This tool is Gambit, a framework that revolutionizes the way we interact with large language models.\nGambit is an agent harness framework that allows you to compose small \u0026ldquo;decks\u0026rdquo; of code with clearly defined inputs and outputs. These decks can be run locally, and you can trace and debug each step with an integrated UI. Thanks to Gambit, you can transform a chaotic workflow into an ordered and verifiable process, reducing errors and improving efficiency. A concrete example is a company that used Gambit to automate the management of customer requests. Thanks to Gambit, they managed to reduce response time by 40% and improve the accuracy of responses by 30%.\nWhat It Does # Gambit is a tool that allows you to build, run, and verify workflows based on large language models (LLM). In practice, Gambit helps you compose small \u0026ldquo;decks\u0026rdquo; of code, called \u0026ldquo;decks,\u0026rdquo; which have clearly defined inputs and outputs. These decks can be run locally, and you can trace and debug each step with an integrated UI. Think of it as a set of clear and ordered instructions that your model follows step by step, without getting lost or making mistakes.\nGambit allows you to define decks in Markdown or TypeScript, making the process of creating workflows extremely flexible. You can run these decks locally with a simple command-line interface (CLI) and simulate executions with an integrated simulator. Additionally, Gambit captures artifacts such as transcripts, traces, and evaluations, making the process of verifying workflows extremely simple and reliable. It is not just an orchestration tool, but a true framework that allows you to manage every aspect of your workflow in a deterministic, portable, and stateless manner.\nWhy It\u0026rsquo;s Amazing # The \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; factor of Gambit lies in its ability to transform complex workflows into simple and verifiable processes. It is not just an orchestration tool, but a complete framework that allows you to manage every aspect of your workflow in a deterministic, portable, and stateless manner.\nDynamic and Contextual: # Gambit allows you to treat each step of your workflow as a small deck with explicit inputs and outputs. This means that every action, including calls to models, is clearly defined and verifiable. For example, imagine having a deck that manages customer requests. Each request is processed contextually, with inputs and outputs clearly defined. This makes the debugging process much simpler and reduces the possibility of errors. \u0026ldquo;Hello, I am your system. Your request has been processed correctly. Here are the details\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is an example of how Gambit can interact with users in a clear and contextual manner.\nReal-time Reasoning: # Gambit allows you to mix LLM tasks and computation tasks within the same deck tree. This means you can perform complex operations in real-time, without having to wait for each step to be completed. For example, imagine having a deck that manages financial transactions. Each transaction is processed in real-time, with inputs and outputs clearly defined. This makes the verification process much simpler and reduces the possibility of errors. \u0026ldquo;Your transaction has been processed correctly. Here are the details\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is an example of how Gambit can interact with users in a clear and real-time manner.\nTraceability and Debugging: # Gambit comes with built-in traceability tools, such as streaming, REPL, and a debug UI. This means you can trace each step of your workflow and debug any issues in a simple and intuitive way. For example, imagine having a deck that manages customer requests. Each request is traced and debugged in real-time, with inputs and outputs clearly defined. This makes the verification process much simpler and reduces the possibility of errors. \u0026ldquo;Your request has been processed correctly. Here are the details\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is an example of how Gambit can interact with users in a clear and traceable manner.\nHow to Try It # To get started with Gambit, follow these simple steps. First, make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed on your system. Then, set up your OpenRouter API key and, if necessary, your OpenRouter base URL. Once you have done this, you can run the Gambit initialization command directly with npx, without having to install anything.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to do it:\nInitialize Gambit:\nexport OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... npx @bolt-foundry/gambit init This command downloads the sample files and sets the necessary environment variables.\nRun an example in the terminal:\nnpx @bolt-foundry/gambit repl gambit/hello.deck.md This example greets you and repeats your message.\nRun an example in the browser:\nnpx @bolt-foundry/gambit serve gambit/hello.deck.md open http://localhost:8000/debug This command starts a local server and opens the debug interface in your browser.\nFor more details, consult the main documentation and the demonstration video. There is no one-click demo, but the setup process is simple and well-documented.\nFinal Thoughts # Gambit represents a significant step forward in how we manage LLM-based workflows. By placing the project in the broader context of the tech ecosystem, we can see how Gambit solves common problems such as lack of traceability and difficulty in debugging. For the community, Gambit offers a unique opportunity to create reliable and verifiable workflows, improving efficiency and reducing errors.\nIn conclusion, Gambit is not just a technical tool, but a solution that can transform the way we interact with large language models.

Ad esempio, se hai bisogno di analizzare un grande dataset per trovare anomalie, ToolOrchestra può coordinare l\u0026rsquo;uso di strumenti di machine learning e di analisi dati per farlo in modo automatico e preciso.\nPerché È Straordinario # Il fattore \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; di ToolOrchestra risiede nella sua capacità di orchestrare strumenti e modelli in modo dinamico e contestuale. Non è un semplice sistema di automazione lineare, ma un vero e proprio direttore d\u0026rsquo;orchestra che sa come e quando utilizzare le risorse disponibili per ottenere i migliori risultati.\nDinamico e contestuale: ToolOrchestra non segue un percorso fisso, ma adatta le sue azioni in base al contesto. Ad esempio, se stai analizzando un dataset e trovi un\u0026rsquo;anomalia, ToolOrchestra può decidere di utilizzare uno strumento di analisi più avanzato per approfondire l\u0026rsquo;indagine. Questo rende il sistema estremamente flessibile e adattabile a situazioni diverse.\nRagionamento in tempo reale: Grazie alle tecniche di Reinforcement Learning, ToolOrchestra può prendere decisioni in tempo reale. Questo è particolarmente utile in scenari dove le condizioni cambiano rapidamente. Ad esempio, in una rete di telecomunicazioni, ToolOrchestra può rilevare un problema e intervenire immediatamente, coordinando l\u0026rsquo;uso di strumenti di diagnostica e di risoluzione per minimizzare i tempi di inattività.\nEfficienza e precisione: ToolOrchestra ha dimostrato di essere più efficiente e preciso rispetto ad altri modelli di intelligenza artificiale. Ad esempio, il modello Orchestrator-8B, sviluppato con ToolOrchestra, ha superato GPT-5 in vari benchmark, dimostrando una maggiore efficienza e precisione. Questo è possibile grazie alla capacità del framework di coordinare l\u0026rsquo;uso di strumenti e modelli specializzati in modo ottimale.\nEsempi concreti: Immagina di dover gestire una rete di telecomunicazioni con migliaia di dispositivi.

Zhang; Tim Kraska; Omar Khattab\nSummary # WHAT - Recursive Language Models (RLMs) are a general-purpose inference paradigm that allows large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts by treating them as part of an external environment. This approach enables the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt.\nWHY - RLMs are relevant because they address the limitation of LLMs in handling long-context tasks, which is crucial for applications requiring processing of tens or hundreds of millions of tokens. They outperform base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across various tasks while maintaining comparable or lower costs.\nWHO - The key actors are researchers from MIT CSAIL, including Alex L. Zhang, Tim Kraska, and Omar Khattab. The technology is also relevant to competitors and companies developing advanced AI models, such as OpenAI and Qwen Team.\nWHERE - RLMs position themselves within the AI ecosystem by offering a scalable solution for long-context processing, competing with other long-context management strategies like context condensation and retrieval-based methods.\nWHEN - RLMs are a relatively new development, aiming to address the growing need for handling long-context tasks as LLMs become more widely adopted. The technology is still in the research and development phase but shows promising results for future integration.\nBUSINESS IMPACT:\nOpportunities: RLMs can be integrated into private AI systems to handle long-context tasks more efficiently, reducing costs and improving performance. This is particularly valuable for applications in research, code repository understanding, and information aggregation. Risks: Competitors like OpenAI and Qwen Team are also developing advanced long-context processing methods, which could pose a threat if they achieve similar or better results. Integration: RLMs can be integrated with existing AI stacks by treating long prompts as external environment variables, allowing for recursive processing and decomposition. This can be implemented using Python REPL environments and sub-LM calls. TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\nCore Technology Stack: RLMs use Python REPL environments to load and interact with long prompts as variables. They leverage sub-LM calls to decompose and process snippets of the prompt recursively. The models evaluated include GPT- and Qwen-Coder-B-AB, with context windows of up to K tokens. Scalability: RLMs can handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond the model context windows, making them highly scalable for long-context tasks. However, the scalability is limited by the efficiency of the recursive calls and the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to manage large datasets. Differentiators: The key differentiators are the ability to treat prompts as external environment variables, allowing for recursive decomposition and processing. This approach outperforms traditional context condensation methods and other long-context scaffolds, maintaining strong performance even for shorter prompts.

Dopo un po\u0026rsquo;, il modello inizia a perdere il filo del discorso, dimenticando dettagli importanti e rendendo le risposte meno accurate. Questo fenomeno, noto come \u0026ldquo;context rot\u0026rdquo;, è un problema comune nei modelli linguistici attuali. Ora, immagina di avere uno strumento che può decomporre e interagire ricorsivamente con il contesto di input di lunghezza illimitata, mantenendo sempre alta la qualità delle risposte. Questo è esattamente ciò che propongono i Recursive Language Models (RLMs), un\u0026rsquo;inferenza strategica che promette di rivoluzionare il modo in cui interagiamo con i modelli linguistici.\nI RLMs sono particolarmente rilevanti oggi, in un\u0026rsquo;epoca in cui la quantità di dati e la complessità delle interazioni stanno crescendo esponenzialmente. La capacità di gestire contesti lunghi e complessi senza perdere informazioni è cruciale per applicazioni come l\u0026rsquo;assistenza virtuale, la ricerca accademica e la generazione di contenuti. In questo articolo, esploreremo cosa sono i RLMs, come funzionano e perché rappresentano un passo avanti significativo nel campo dell\u0026rsquo;intelligenza artificiale.\nDi Cosa Parla # I Recursive Language Models (RLMs) sono un\u0026rsquo;inferenza strategica che permette ai modelli linguistici di decomporre e interagire ricorsivamente con il contesto di input di lunghezza illimitata attraverso ambienti REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). In pratica, un RLM può chiamare se stesso o altri modelli linguistici per elaborare input complessi, mantenendo alta la qualità delle risposte. Questo approccio è simile a quello di un programma che si chiama ricorsivamente per risolvere problemi complessi, ma applicato ai modelli linguistici.\nPensa ai RLMs come a un modello linguistico che può suddividere un problema grande in sottoproblemi più piccoli, risolvere ciascuno di essi e poi combinare i risultati per ottenere una risposta finale. Questo è possibile grazie a un ambiente REPL, che permette al modello di interagire con il contesto di input come se fosse un programma. Ad esempio, un RLM può leggere e scrivere in un notebook Python, utilizzando il contesto di input come variabile in memoria. Questo approccio non solo migliora la capacità del modello di gestire contesti lunghi, ma riduce anche il costo delle query, rendendo i RLMs una soluzione efficiente e potente.\nPerché È Rilevante # I RLMs rappresentano un passo avanti significativo nel campo dell\u0026rsquo;intelligenza artificiale per diverse ragioni. Innanzitutto, mitigano il problema del \u0026ldquo;context rot\u0026rdquo;, migliorando la capacità dei modelli linguistici di gestire contesti lunghi e complessi. Questo è particolarmente utile in scenari come l\u0026rsquo;assistenza virtuale, dove le conversazioni possono diventare lunghe e intricate. Ad esempio, un RLM può gestire una conversazione di migliaia di token senza perdere il filo del discorso, migliorando significativamente l\u0026rsquo;esperienza utente.\nInoltre, i RLMs sono più efficienti dal punto di vista dei costi. In uno studio condotto da Alex L. Zhang, un RLM che utilizza GPT-mini ha superato GPT in un benchmark di contesti lunghi, raddoppiando il numero di risposte corrette e riducendo il costo delle query. Questo rende i RLMs una soluzione attraente per aziende e sviluppatori che cercano di ottimizzare le risorse senza compromettere la qualità delle risposte.\nInfine, i RLMs aprono nuove possibilità per l\u0026rsquo;inferenza a tempo di esecuzione. Secondo Zhang, i RLMs rappresentano il prossimo milione di inferenza a tempo di esecuzione dopo i modelli di ragionamento CoT-style e ReAct-style. Questo significa che i RLMs potrebbero diventare uno standard per l\u0026rsquo;inferenza a tempo di esecuzione, migliorando la capacità dei modelli linguistici di gestire contesti complessi e lunghi.\nApplicazioni Pratiche # I RLMs hanno un ampio spettro di applicazioni pratiche. Ad esempio, possono essere utilizzati in sistemi di assistenza virtuale per gestire conversazioni lunghe e complesse senza perdere il filo del discorso. Questo è particolarmente utile in settori come il supporto clienti, dove le conversazioni possono diventare intricate e richiedere un alto livello di precisione.\nUn altro scenario d\u0026rsquo;uso è la ricerca accademica. I RLMs possono essere utilizzati per analizzare grandi quantità di testo, come articoli scientifici o libri, senza perdere informazioni importanti. Questo può migliorare la capacità dei ricercatori di trovare informazioni rilevanti e di generare nuove ipotesi.\nPer gli sviluppatori, i RLMs offrono un ambiente REPL che può essere utilizzato per testare e migliorare i modelli linguistici. Ad esempio, un RLM può essere utilizzato per testare la capacità di un modello di gestire contesti lunghi e complessi, identificando eventuali problemi e migliorando la qualità delle risposte.\nPer approfondire, puoi consultare il paper completo e il codice ufficiale dei Recursive Language Models (RLMs) disponibili sui link forniti nell\u0026rsquo;articolo originale.\nConsiderazioni Finali # I Recursive Language Models (RLMs) rappresentano un passo avanti significativo nel campo dell\u0026rsquo;intelligenza artificiale, offrendo una soluzione efficace per gestire contesti lunghi e complessi. La capacità di decomporre e interagire ricorsivamente con il contesto di input attraverso ambienti REPL apre nuove possibilità per l\u0026rsquo;inferenza a tempo di esecuzione, migliorando la qualità delle risposte e riducendo i costi.\nIn un\u0026rsquo;epoca in cui la quantità di dati e la complessità delle interazioni stanno crescendo esponenzialmente, i RLMs offrono una soluzione potente e versatile. Che tu sia un ricercatore, un sviluppatore o un utente finale, i RLMs possono migliorare la tua capacità di gestire contesti complessi e lunghi, rendendo le tue interazioni con i modelli linguistici più efficaci e accurate.\nCasi d\u0026rsquo;uso # Private AI Stack: Integrazione in pipeline proprietarie Client Solutions: Implementazione per progetti clienti Risorse # Link Originali # Recursive Language Models | Alex L.

Questo è il tipo di sfida che i modelli linguistici di grandi dimensioni (LLM) stanno affrontando oggi. Questi modelli sono diventati strumenti potenti, capaci di implementare cambiamenti autonomi in grandi codebase, ma gestire contesti estremamente lunghi rimane una sfida significativa. La soluzione? I modelli linguistici ricorsivi (RLM), una tecnologia che promette di rivoluzionare il modo in cui gestiamo contesti lunghi e complessi.\nI modelli linguistici ricorsivi rappresentano una svolta nel campo dell\u0026rsquo;intelligenza artificiale, offrendo un approccio innovativo per gestire contesti estremamente lunghi. Questo articolo esplora come i RLM possono superare i limiti attuali degli LLM, rendendo possibile la gestione di progetti complessi con maggiore efficienza e precisione. Scopriremo come questa tecnologia funziona, perché è rilevante e come può essere applicata in scenari pratici.\nDi Cosa Parla # Questo articolo si concentra sui modelli linguistici ricorsivi (RLM) e su come possono gestire contesti estremamente lunghi in modo più efficiente rispetto agli attuali LLM. I RLM permettono ai modelli di gestire autonomamente il proprio contesto, evitando problemi come il \u0026ldquo;context rot\u0026rdquo; e riducendo i costi associati alla gestione di grandi quantità di dati. Questo strumento utilizza un approccio ricorsivo che delega il contesto a script Python e sub-LLM, permettendo una gestione più flessibile e scalabile.\nIn sintesi, i RLM offrono una soluzione innovativa per gestire contesti lunghi, migliorando l\u0026rsquo;efficienza e la precisione dei modelli linguistici. Questo approccio è particolarmente utile in scenari dove è necessario mantenere la coerenza e la memoria di operazioni complesse, come nella gestione di grandi codebase o nella realizzazione di progetti software complessi.\nPerché È Rilevante # Efficienza e Precisione # I modelli linguistici ricorsivi (RLM) rappresentano un passo avanti significativo nella gestione di contesti lunghi. Attualmente, gli LLM affrontano problemi come il \u0026ldquo;context rot\u0026rdquo;, che riduce le loro capacità man mano che il contesto cresce. I RLM, invece, permettono ai modelli di gestire autonomamente il proprio contesto, evitando la perdita di informazioni e migliorando l\u0026rsquo;efficienza. Questo è particolarmente rilevante in un contesto in cui la gestione di grandi quantità di dati è diventata la norma.\nCasi d\u0026rsquo;Uso Concreti # Un esempio concreto di utilizzo dei RLM è la gestione di progetti software complessi. Immagina un team di sviluppo che lavora su un\u0026rsquo;applicazione con migliaia di file.

Con i RLM, il modello può delegare il contesto a script Python e sub-LLM, permettendo una gestione più flessibile e scalabile. Questo approccio è stato implementato con successo da Prime Intellect, che ha utilizzato i RLM in verificatori pronti per essere utilizzati in qualsiasi ambiente.\nRiduzione dei Costi # Un altro vantaggio significativo dei RLM è la riduzione dei costi associati alla gestione di grandi quantità di dati. I costi per token aumentano linearmente con la lunghezza del contesto, e la performance degli LLM tende a diminuire. I RLM, invece, permettono di gestire il contesto in modo più efficiente, riducendo i costi e migliorando la performance. Questo è particolarmente rilevante in un contesto in cui la gestione dei costi è una priorità.\nApplicazioni Pratiche # I modelli linguistici ricorsivi (RLM) trovano applicazione in vari scenari pratici, rendendoli uno strumento versatile per developer e tech enthusiast.

Tutto sembra perfetto durante la demo: l\u0026rsquo;utente chiede di visualizzare i clienti con il maggior fatturato e l\u0026rsquo;AI genera una query SQL perfetta, restituendo dati impeccabili. Gli utenti sono entusiasti, ma solo per pochi secondi. Quando provano a fare una domanda di follow-up, l\u0026rsquo;AI sembra aver perso la memoria. \u0026ldquo;Ordini di chi?\u0026rdquo; chiede l\u0026rsquo;AI, come se non avesse appena mostrato i clienti con il maggior fatturato. Questo è il problema che abbiamo affrontato con SQLatte, il nostro strumento AI che converte il linguaggio naturale in SQL.\nQuesto problema è comune a molti modelli di linguaggio di grandi dimensioni (LLM), come GPT, Claude e Gemini. Questi modelli sono progettati per essere stateless, il che significa che generano una risposta e poi dimenticano tutto. Per gli utenti, questo è frustrante e può portare a un abbandono rapido del servizio. Abbiamo dovuto trovare una soluzione per far ricordare all\u0026rsquo;AI il contesto delle conversazioni, migliorando così l\u0026rsquo;esperienza utente e riducendo i support tickets.\nDi Cosa Parla # Questo articolo esplora il problema della memoria a breve termine nei modelli di linguaggio di grandi dimensioni e come abbiamo risolto questo problema per SQLatte. Iniziamo con un esempio concreto: l\u0026rsquo;AI che dimentica il contesto delle conversazioni dopo ogni risposta. Questo fenomeno, che chiamiamo \u0026ldquo;effetto pesce rosso\u0026rdquo;, è un ostacolo significativo per l\u0026rsquo;adozione di queste tecnologie. Per risolvere questo problema, abbiamo sperimentato diverse soluzioni, tra cui la memorizzazione completa delle conversazioni e l\u0026rsquo;uso di finestre di contesto ottimizzate. La nostra soluzione finale è un\u0026rsquo;architettura che simula la memoria umana, permettendo all\u0026rsquo;AI di ricordare solo le informazioni rilevanti per la conversazione corrente.\nPerché È Rilevante # L\u0026rsquo;Impatto dell\u0026rsquo;Effetto Pesce Rosso # L\u0026rsquo;effetto pesce rosso è un problema reale che influisce negativamente sull\u0026rsquo;esperienza utente. In un caso concreto, abbiamo osservato che il 50% degli utenti abbandonava il servizio dopo la seconda domanda, con una sessione media di solo 2 query. Questo ha portato a un aumento dei support tickets e a una percezione negativa del nostro strumento. Per esempio, un utente ha chiesto di visualizzare i clienti di New York e poi ha chiesto quanti ordini avevano effettuato. L\u0026rsquo;AI ha risposto chiedendo di specificare quali clienti, portando l\u0026rsquo;utente a chiudere la scheda frustrato.\nLa Soluzione: Finestre di Contesto Ottimizzate # Dopo aver sperimentato diverse soluzioni, abbiamo scoperto che la chiave era l\u0026rsquo;uso di finestre di contesto ottimizzate. Abbiamo testato diverse configurazioni e abbiamo trovato che mantenere solo gli ultimi 3 messaggi era la soluzione ottimale. Questo approccio ha ridotto i costi di token e migliorato la soddisfazione degli utenti, aumentando il tasso di successo delle conversazioni. Per esempio, mantenendo solo gli ultimi 3 messaggi, abbiamo ridotto i costi di token del 70% e migliorato la soddisfazione degli utenti del 50%.\nTendenze del Settore # La gestione del contesto è una delle sfide più importanti nel campo dell\u0026rsquo;intelligenza artificiale. Con l\u0026rsquo;aumento dell\u0026rsquo;uso di assistenti virtuali e chatbot, la capacità di mantenere il contesto delle conversazioni è cruciale per migliorare l\u0026rsquo;esperienza utente.

Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to be able to do this, but they often prove ineffective, forcing us to repeatedly provide context to make them \u0026ldquo;understand.\u0026rdquo; This is a problem many of us have encountered, making working with these models frustrating and inefficient.\nThe issue lies in the difference between LLM memory and human memory. Humans are capable of learning and improving with experience, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t remember every detail. LLMs, on the other hand, are designed for near-perfect recall, but this makes them inefficient with long contexts. This is where NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s new approach comes into play: test-time training with an end-to-end formulation (TTT-EE). This method allows LLMs to compress the context in which they operate into their weights, significantly improving their ability to learn and adapt in real-time.\nWhat It\u0026rsquo;s About # This NVIDIA technical blog article explores the current limitations of LLMs and introduces an innovative solution to improve their ability to handle long contexts. The main focus is on test-time training with an end-to-end formulation (TTT-EE), a method that allows LLMs to compress the context in which they operate into their weights through next-token prediction. This approach is comparable to how humans compress experiences into insights, allowing LLMs to learn and adapt in real-time.\nThe key point is that TTT-EE scales well in terms of both loss and latency, unlike other methods such as Transformers with full attention or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This makes TTT-EE a promising solution for addressing one of the most fundamental problems in LLM research: handling long contexts.\nWhy It\u0026rsquo;s Relevant # Efficiency and Scalability # TTT-EE represents a significant step forward in managing long contexts. While traditional methods like Transformers with full attention or RNNs have notable limitations, TTT-EE maintains low loss and consistent latency, regardless of context length. This is crucial for applications that require handling large amounts of data, such as automatic translation, long text analysis, or managing complex conversations.\nConcrete Examples # A concrete example is the use of TTT-EE in a customer support system. Imagine a chatbot that needs to manage entire conversations with a customer, remembering important details without having to repeatedly provide the context. With TTT-EE, the chatbot can compress relevant information into its weights, improving the quality of responses and reducing response time. This not only improves the user experience but also reduces operational costs for the company.\nImpact on the Sector # The introduction of TTT-EE has significant implications for the machine learning and artificial intelligence sectors. This method could revolutionize how we manage and use data, making LLMs more efficient and adaptable. Additionally, TTT-EE could open new possibilities for applications that require advanced context management, such as scientific research, historical text analysis, or creating personalized content.\nPractical Applications # Use Cases # TTT-EE is particularly useful for developers and researchers working with large volumes of data. For example, a research team analyzing historical texts can use TTT-EE to compress and manage relevant information without having to repeatedly provide the context. This allows for more accurate results and reduces the time needed for analysis.\nWho It\u0026rsquo;s Useful For # This content is useful for anyone working with large language models, both in academic and industrial settings. Developers, researchers, and data scientists can benefit from TTT-EE to improve the efficiency and adaptability of their models. Additionally, companies using chatbots or customer support systems can implement TTT-EE to improve the quality of user interactions.\nHow to Apply the Information # To apply TTT-EE, it is first necessary to understand the functioning of test-time training and end-to-end formulation. NVIDIA has made the paper and code publicly available, allowing anyone to experiment and implement this method. Additionally, you can consult the resources and tutorials available on NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s website to deepen your knowledge and apply TTT-EE in your projects.\nFinal Thoughts # NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s research on TTT-EE represents a significant step forward in managing long contexts for LLMs. This method not only improves the efficiency and adaptability of models but also opens new possibilities for advanced applications. In the context of the tech ecosystem, TTT-EE could become a standard for data management, influencing how we develop and use large language models.\nFor readers, this article provides a comprehensive overview of TTT-EE, highlighting its value and potential. Implementing TTT-EE in your projects can lead to significant improvements in terms of efficiency and quality, making large language models more powerful and adaptable.\nUse Cases # Private AI Stack: Integration into proprietary pipelines Client Solutions: Implementation for client projects Development Acceleration: Reduction in time-to-market for projects Resources # Original Links # Reimagining LLM Memory: Using Context as Training Data Unlocks Models That Learn at Test-Time - Original link Article recommended and selected by the Human Technology eXcellence team, processed through artificial intelligence (in this case with LLM HTX-EU-Mistral3.1Small) on 2026-01-15 07:58 Original source: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/reimagining-llm-memory-using-context-as-training-data-unlocks-models-that-learn-at-test-time/\nRelated Articles # GitHub - aiming-lab/SimpleMem: SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents - LLM, Python, Open Source LLMRouter - LLMRouter - AI, LLM GitHub - memodb-io/Acontext: Data platform for context engineering.

Ogni riga di codice che scrivi potrebbe avere un impatto diretto sulla sicurezza e l\u0026rsquo;efficienza di servizi essenziali. Ora, immagina che una nuova direttiva europea stia per cambiare radicalmente le regole del gioco, rendendo il software soggetto a responsabilità oggettiva, come se fosse un prodotto fisico. Questo è esattamente ciò che sta per accadere con l\u0026rsquo;entrata in vigore della nuova Product Liability Directive (PLD) a dicembre 2026. Questa direttiva non solo equipara il software ai beni fisici, ma elimina anche la possibilità di escludere la responsabilità tramite disclaimer. È un cambiamento epocale che richiede una riflessione profonda su come sviluppiamo, distribuiamo e manteniamo il software.\nLa PLD rappresenta un punto di svolta per l\u0026rsquo;industria del software in Europa. Non si tratta solo di una nuova normativa, ma di un vero e proprio cambio di paradigma. Le aziende devono prepararsi a ripensare le loro politiche di sicurezza e gestione del rischio, assicurandosi di essere completamente conformi non solo alla PLD, ma anche ad altre normative europee come il GDPR e la NIS. In questo articolo, esploreremo le implicazioni di questa nuova direttiva, fornendo esempi concreti e scenari d\u0026rsquo;uso per aiutarti a capire come prepararti al meglio.\nDi Cosa Parla # La nuova direttiva europea sulla responsabilità per prodotti difettosi (PLD) introduce una serie di cambiamenti significativi per il settore del software. In sintesi, il software, sia standalone che integrato in dispositivi, sarà soggetto a responsabilità oggettiva, come se fosse un prodotto fisico. Questo significa che i produttori di software dovranno dimostrare che il loro prodotto non è difettoso e che non ha causato danni ai consumatori. La direttiva copre una vasta gamma di software, inclusi firmware, applicazioni SaaS, e persino sistemi di intelligenza artificiale.\nLa PLD elimina la possibilità di escludere la responsabilità tramite disclaimer, rendendo i produttori direttamente responsabili dei danni causati dai loro prodotti. Questo include danni materiali, danni ai dati digitali, e persino lesioni psicologiche certificate. La direttiva si applicherà a tutti i prodotti immessi sul mercato dopo il 12 dicembre 2026, e i produttori avranno un termine massimo di 10 anni per la responsabilità, esteso a 15 anni per i danni alla persona che si manifestano tardivamente.\nPerché È Rilevante # Impatto sulla Sicurezza e Gestione del Rischio # La PLD rappresenta un cambiamento radicale per l\u0026rsquo;industria del software. I produttori dovranno ripensare completamente le loro politiche di sicurezza e gestione del rischio. La mancata conformità a normative come il GDPR e la NIS costituirà un indizio di difettosità del prodotto, rendendo ancora più critica la compliance. Ad esempio, un\u0026rsquo;azienda che sviluppa software per dispositivi medici dovrà assicurarsi che il suo prodotto sia completamente conforme alla PLD, oltre che alle normative specifiche del settore sanitario.\nEsempi Concreti # Consideriamo il caso di una startup che sviluppa un sistema di intelligenza artificiale per la gestione del traffico urbano. Se il sistema dovesse causare un incidente a causa di un difetto, la startup potrebbe essere ritenuta responsabile. La PLD richiede che la startup dimostri che il difetto non è stato causato da negligenza o colpa, e che il danno è direttamente collegato al prodotto. Questo significa che la startup dovrà investire in test rigorosi e in una gestione del rischio avanzata per evitare potenziali responsabilità legali.\nTendenze Attuali del Settore # La PLD si inserisce in un contesto di crescente attenzione alla sicurezza e alla conformità nel settore del software. Con l\u0026rsquo;aumento dell\u0026rsquo;uso di software in settori critici come la sanità, l\u0026rsquo;energia e i trasporti, è fondamentale che i produttori garantiscano la sicurezza e l\u0026rsquo;affidabilità dei loro prodotti. La PLD rappresenta un passo avanti significativo in questa direzione, imponendo standard più elevati e responsabilità più chiare per i produttori di software.\nApplicazioni Pratiche # Scenari d\u0026rsquo;Uso # La PLD avrà un impatto significativo su vari settori. Ad esempio, le aziende che sviluppano software per dispositivi medici dovranno assicurarsi che i loro prodotti siano completamente conformi alla direttiva. Questo potrebbe includere test rigorosi, audit di sicurezza e implementazione di politiche di gestione del rischio avanzate. Un altro esempio è rappresentato dalle aziende che sviluppano software per la gestione del traffico urbano. Questi sistemi devono essere estremamente affidabili, e la PLD impone standard di sicurezza ancora più elevati.\nA Chi È Utile Questo Contenuto # Questo articolo è utile per developer, project manager, e responsabili della conformità in aziende che sviluppano software. Se lavori in un\u0026rsquo;azienda che produce software mission-critical, è fondamentale che tu comprenda le implicazioni della PLD e come prepararti al meglio. La direttiva richiede un approccio proattivo alla gestione del rischio e alla sicurezza, e questo articolo ti fornisce le informazioni necessarie per iniziare.\nCome Applicare le Informazioni # Per prepararti alla PLD, inizia con un audit completo delle tue politiche di sicurezza e gestione del rischio. Assicurati che il tuo software sia conforme non solo alla PLD, ma anche ad altre normative rilevanti come il GDPR e la NIS. Investi in test rigorosi e implementa politiche di gestione del rischio avanzate. Inoltre, considera di formare il tuo team sulle nuove normative e sulle migliori pratiche per garantire la conformità.\nConsiderazioni Finali # La nuova direttiva europea sulla responsabilità per prodotti difettosi rappresenta un cambiamento epocale per l\u0026rsquo;industria del software. La PLD impone standard di sicurezza più elevati e responsabilità più chiare per i produttori di software, rendendo necessario un ripensamento completo delle politiche di sicurezza e gestione del rischio. Per prepararti al meglio, è fondamentale comprendere le implicazioni della direttiva e adottare un approccio proattivo alla conformità. La PLD non è solo una nuova normativa, ma un\u0026rsquo;opportunità per migliorare la sicurezza e l\u0026rsquo;affidabilità del software che sviluppiamo, garantendo un futuro più sicuro per tutti.\nCasi d\u0026rsquo;uso # Private AI Stack: Integrazione in pipeline proprietarie Client Solutions: Implementazione per progetti clienti Risorse # Link Originali # Il Disclaimer muore. - Link originale Articolo segnalato e selezionato dal team Human Technology eXcellence elaborato tramite intelligenza artificiale (in questo caso con LLM HTX-EU-Mistral3.1Small) il 2026-01-15 08:08 Fonte originale: https://keinpfusch.net/il-disclaimer-muore/\nArticoli Correlati # Keycloak - Tech You Should Write An Agent · The Fly Blog - AI Agent AI Explained - Stanford Research Paper.pdf - Google Drive - Go, AI ","date":"14 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2026/01/il-disclaimer-muore/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Il Disclaimer muore.","type":"posts"},{"content":" #### Fonte Tipo: GitHub Repository\nLink originale: https://github.com/fullstackwebdev/rlm_repl\nData pubblicazione: 2026-01-13\nSintesi # Introduzione # Immagina di essere un ricercatore che deve analizzare un dataset di migliaia di pagine di testo, cercando di estrarre informazioni specifiche. Ogni documento è diverso, alcuni sono in formato PDF, altri in Word, e altri ancora in testo semplice. Inoltre, i dati sono sparsi su diversi server e database, rendendo difficile avere una visione completa. Ogni tentativo di analisi si scontra con limiti di memoria e tempo di esecuzione, rendendo il compito quasi impossibile.\nOra, immagina di avere uno strumento che può gestire tutto questo in modo efficiente. Un sistema che può elaborare prompt di lunghezza arbitraria, eseguire codice Python direttamente all\u0026rsquo;interno del contesto di analisi, e mantenere traccia dei costi di elaborazione. Questo è esattamente ciò che offre rlm_repl, un\u0026rsquo;implementazione di Recursive Language Models (RLMs) basata sul lavoro di Zhang, Kraska e Khattab. Questo progetto rivoluziona il modo in cui possiamo interagire con grandi quantità di dati testuali, rendendo possibile l\u0026rsquo;analisi di contesti estremamente lunghi e complessi.\nCosa Fa # rlm_repl è un\u0026rsquo;implementazione di Recursive Language Models (RLMs) che permette ai modelli linguistici di elaborare prompt di lunghezza arbitraria attraverso un meccanismo di scaling durante l\u0026rsquo;inferenza. In pratica, il sistema tratta il prompt come parte di un ambiente esterno, permettendo di gestire contesti che superano i limiti di memoria e tempo di esecuzione dei modelli linguistici tradizionali.\nIl cuore del progetto è il REPL Environment, un sandbox di esecuzione Python che permette di eseguire codice direttamente all\u0026rsquo;interno del contesto di analisi. Questo ambiente mantiene uno stato persistente tra le iterazioni, catturando output e gestendo variabili intermedie. Inoltre, il sistema include funzionalità avanzate come il tracciamento dei costi di elaborazione, la gestione del contesto esterno, e la possibilità di eseguire chiamate ricorsive ai modelli linguistici.\nPerché È Straordinario # Il fattore \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; di rlm_repl risiede nella sua capacità di gestire contesti estremamente lunghi e complessi, superando i limiti dei modelli linguistici tradizionali. Ecco alcune delle caratteristiche chiave che rendono questo progetto straordinario:\nDinamico e contestuale: rlm_repl non si limita a elaborare prompt di lunghezza fissa. Grazie al suo meccanismo di scaling durante l\u0026rsquo;inferenza, può gestire prompt di lunghezza arbitraria, trattandoli come parte di un ambiente esterno. Questo permette di elaborare contesti che superano i limiti di memoria e tempo di esecuzione dei modelli linguistici tradizionali. Ad esempio, un ricercatore può caricare migliaia di pagine di testo in un unico prompt, e il sistema sarà in grado di elaborarlo senza problemi. \u0026ldquo;Ciao, sono il tuo sistema. Il servizio X è offline\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; potrebbe essere una risposta generata dal sistema, indicando che un servizio specifico non è disponibile, ma il contesto generale è stato comunque elaborato correttamente.\nRagionamento in tempo reale: Il REPL Environment permette di eseguire codice Python direttamente all\u0026rsquo;interno del contesto di analisi. Questo significa che il sistema può ragionare in tempo reale, eseguendo operazioni complesse e prendendo decisioni basate sui dati in input. Ad esempio, un analista finanziario potrebbe utilizzare rlm_repl per analizzare transazioni sospette in tempo reale, identificando potenziali frodi con una precisione senza precedenti. \u0026ldquo;Transazione sospetta rilevata: importo anomalo rispetto alla media mensile\u0026rdquo; potrebbe essere un esempio di output generato dal sistema.\nEfficienza e tracciamento dei costi: rlm_repl include un sistema avanzato di tracciamento dei costi, che permette di monitorare l\u0026rsquo;uso delle risorse in tempo reale. Questo è particolarmente utile per applicazioni che richiedono un controllo rigoroso dei costi, come l\u0026rsquo;analisi di grandi dataset o l\u0026rsquo;elaborazione di prompt complessi. Ad esempio, un\u0026rsquo;azienda potrebbe utilizzare rlm_repl per analizzare i dati di vendita, monitorando i costi di elaborazione e ottimizzando le risorse in base alle esigenze specifiche. \u0026ldquo;Costo totale dell\u0026rsquo;analisi: $5.23\u0026rdquo; potrebbe essere un esempio di output generato dal sistema, indicando il costo totale dell\u0026rsquo;operazione.\nConfigurabilità e flessibilità: rlm_repl è altamente configurabile, permettendo di personalizzare il comportamento del sistema in base alle esigenze specifiche. Ad esempio, è possibile impostare il numero massimo di iterazioni, la lunghezza massima dell\u0026rsquo;output, e molto altro. Questo rende il sistema estremamente flessibile, adattabile a una vasta gamma di applicazioni e scenari. Un team di sviluppo potrebbe utilizzare rlm_repl per analizzare il codice sorgente, configurando il sistema per eseguire un numero specifico di iterazioni e monitorando i costi di elaborazione in tempo reale.\nCome Provarlo # Per iniziare con rlm_repl, segui questi passaggi:\nClona il repository: Puoi trovare il codice su GitHub al seguente indirizzo: rlm_repl. Usa il comando git clone https://github.com/fullstackwebdev/rlm_repl.git per clonare il repository sul tuo computer.\nPrerequisiti: Assicurati di avere Python installato sul tuo sistema. Non ci sono dipendenze aggiuntive richieste, poiché il progetto utilizza solo librerie standard di Python.\nSetup: Una volta clonato il repository, puoi iniziare a utilizzare rlm_repl. Ecco un esempio di come creare un\u0026rsquo;istanza del sistema e processare un contesto lungo:\nfrom rlm.rlm_repl import RLM_REPL # Creare un\u0026#39;istanza di RLM rlm = RLM_REPL( model=\u0026#34;auto\u0026#34;, # Seleziona automaticamente il primo modello disponibile recursive_model=\u0026#34;auto\u0026#34;, # Seleziona automaticamente il primo modello disponibile max_iterations=10 ) # Processare un contesto lungo result = rlm.completion( context=\u0026#34;Molto lungo contesto...\u0026#34;, query=\u0026#34;Qual è la risposta alla domanda?\u0026#34; ) # Ottenere il riepilogo dei costi costs = rlm.cost_summary() print(f\u0026#34;Costo totale: ${costs[\u0026#39;total_cost\u0026#39;]:.4f}\u0026#34;) Documentazione: Per ulteriori dettagli, consulta la documentazione principale disponibile nel repository. La documentazione copre aspetti come l\u0026rsquo;installazione, la configurazione, e l\u0026rsquo;uso avanzato del sistema. Considerazioni Finali # rlm_repl rappresenta un passo avanti significativo nel campo dei modelli linguistici, offrendo una soluzione innovativa per l\u0026rsquo;elaborazione di contesti estremamente lunghi e complessi. Questo progetto non solo supera i limiti dei modelli linguistici tradizionali, ma apre nuove possibilità per l\u0026rsquo;analisi di grandi dataset e l\u0026rsquo;elaborazione di prompt complessi.\nNel contesto più ampio dell\u0026rsquo;ecosistema tech, rlm_repl dimostra come l\u0026rsquo;innovazione possa emergere dall\u0026rsquo;intersezione tra ricerca accademica e sviluppo pratico. Questo progetto è un esempio di come le idee teoriche possano essere trasformate in strumenti concreti, capaci di risolvere problemi reali e migliorare la vita dei developer e degli analisti.\nConcludendo, rlm_repl è un progetto che merita attenzione e sperimentazione. La sua capacità di gestire contesti lunghi, eseguire codice in tempo reale, e monitorare i costi di elaborazione lo rende uno strumento prezioso per chiunque lavori con grandi quantità di dati testuali.

Every day, you manage an enormous amount of data from various sources: different types of documents, recorded conversations, images, and videos. Each piece of information is crucial, but it is also fragmented and difficult to organize. How do you keep everything under control and ensure that your AI can quickly and intelligently access all the necessary information?\nMemU is the solution you have always been looking for. This agentic memory framework for LLM (Large Language Models) and AI agents is designed to receive multimodal inputs, extract structured information, and organize it efficiently. Thanks to MemU, you can transform chaotic data into a coherent and accessible memory, allowing your AI to operate with unprecedented precision and speed.\nWhat It Does # MemU is a memory framework that manages and organizes information from various sources. In practice, MemU receives inputs of different types (conversations, documents, images, videos) and transforms them into a hierarchical and easily navigable memory structure. This process allows for the extraction of useful information and its organization so that it can be retrieved quickly and contextually.\nThink of MemU as an intelligent archive that not only stores data but organizes it so that it can be used effectively. For example, if you have a recorded conversation, MemU can extract preferences, opinions, and habits, and organize them into specific categories. The same applies to documents, images, and videos: each type of input is processed and integrated into a unified memory structure.\nWhy It\u0026rsquo;s Amazing # The \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; factor of MemU lies in its ability to handle multimodal inputs and organize information dynamically and contextually. It is not just a simple linear storage system, but a framework that adapts and improves over time.\nDynamic and contextual: # MemU uses a three-level hierarchical storage system: Resource, Object, and Category. This allows for tracking each piece of information from the raw data to the final category, ensuring complete traceability. Each level provides a more abstract view of the data, allowing for quick and contextual information retrieval. For example, if you are looking for information on a specific preference, MemU can guide you directly to the correct category without having to sift through mountains of data.\nReal-time reasoning: # MemU supports two retrieval methods: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for speed and LLM (Large Language Models) for deep semantic understanding. This means you can get quick answers when you need immediate information, but also detailed insights when more complex reasoning is required. \u0026ldquo;Hello, I am your system. Service X is offline\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is an example of how MemU can provide contextual and immediate responses.\nAdaptability and continuous improvement: # MemU is not static; its memory structure adapts and improves based on usage patterns. This means the more you use MemU, the more efficient and accurate it becomes. For example, if you notice that certain categories of information are retrieved more frequently, MemU can reorganize the memory to make this data more accessible.\nMultimodal support: # MemU is designed to handle a wide range of input types: conversations, documents, images, audio, and video. Each type of input is processed and integrated into the same memory structure, allowing for cross-modal retrieval. This is particularly useful in complex scenarios where information comes from different sources and needs to be integrated coherently.\nHow to Try It # To get started with MemU, you can choose between two main options: the cloud version or local installation. The cloud version is the simplest and fastest solution, as it requires no configuration. You can access MemU via the site memu.so, which offers a cloud service with full API access.\nIf you prefer a local installation, you can find the source code on GitHub at the following address: https://github.com/NevaMind-AI/memU. The prerequisites include Python and some specific dependencies that are detailed in the documentation. Once you have cloned the repository, follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up the environment and start the system.\nThere is no one-click demo, but the setup process is well documented and supported by the community.

You have a vast amount of historical documents at your disposal, but the task of analyzing them and drawing significant conclusions is arduous and time-consuming. Now, imagine having a language model trained on tens of billions of tokens of historical data, capable of answering complex questions and providing contextual information without being influenced by future events. This is exactly what the History LLMs project offers.\nHistory LLMs is an information hub that focuses on training the largest possible historical language models. These models, based on the Qwen3 architecture, have been trained from scratch on 80 billion tokens of historical data, with knowledge cutoffs up to 1913, 1929, and 1933. This innovative approach allows for exploring the past without contamination from future events, offering a more authentic and accurate view of history.\nWhat It Does # History LLMs is a project aimed at creating large-scale language models trained on historical data. These models, known as Ranke-4B, are based on the Qwen3 architecture and have been trained on a vast amount of historical data, totaling 80 billion tokens. The goal is to provide advanced tools for historical research, allowing scholars to explore the past more accurately and in detail.\nThink of History LLMs as an extremely competent digital archivist. This archivist not only knows a vast amount of historical information but is also able to answer complex questions and provide specific contexts. For example, if you ask who Adolf Hitler was, the model trained up to 1913 will not know how to answer, because it has no information on subsequent events. This approach ensures that the answers are based exclusively on the historical data available up to that point, avoiding any contamination from future events.\nWhy It\u0026rsquo;s Amazing # The \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; factor of History LLMs lies in its ability to provide contextual and accurate answers based exclusively on historical data. It is not just a language model that repeats learned information; it is an advanced research tool that can be used to explore the past more authentically.\nDynamic and contextual: History LLMs is able to provide contextual answers based on a vast amount of historical data. For example, if you ask for information about a specific event, the model can provide not only the facts but also the historical context in which that event occurred. This is particularly useful for historians seeking to understand the dynamics of a past era.\nReal-time reasoning: Thanks to its advanced architecture, History LLMs is able to answer complex questions in real-time. This means you can ask specific questions and get immediate answers, without having to wait for long processing times. For example, if you ask \u0026ldquo;What were the main causes of the Industrial Revolution?\u0026rdquo;, the model can provide a detailed and contextual answer in a few seconds.\nExploration without contamination: One of the most innovative aspects of History LLMs is its ability to explore the past without contamination from future events. This is possible thanks to the knowledge cutoff set on specific dates, such as 1913. For example, if you ask for information about a historical figure, the model will not know how to answer if that information was acquired after 1913. This ensures that the answers are based exclusively on the historical data available up to that point, avoiding any influence from future events.\nConcrete examples: A concrete example of how History LLMs can be used is historical research on specific events. For example, if you are studying World War I, you can ask specific questions about the historical context, the causes, and the consequences of the conflict. The model can provide detailed and contextual answers, helping you to better understand historical events. Another example is the analysis of historical documents. If you have a vast amount of different types of documents, such as letters, newspapers, and books, History LLMs can help you analyze them and draw significant conclusions. For example, you can ask the model to identify the main themes discussed in the documents and provide a contextual analysis.\nHow to Try It # To start using History LLMs, follow these steps:\nClone the repository: You can find the source code on GitHub at the following address: history-llms. Clone the repository to your computer using the command git clone https://github.com/DGoettlich/history-llms.git.\nPrerequisites: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Every day, thousands of new data points arrive that need to be analyzed to improve the user experience and prevent fraud. However, managing these data is complex and requires the use of multiple different systems, such as databases, file storage, and vector databases, which often do not communicate efficiently with each other.\nPixeltable is an innovative solution that addresses this problem by offering a declarative and incremental data infrastructure for multimodal AI applications. With Pixeltable, you can define the entire data processing and AI workflow declaratively, focusing on the application logic rather than data management. This approach not only simplifies the process but also makes it easier to integrate new data and update analyses in real-time.\nWhat It Does # Pixeltable is an open-source library written in Python that provides a declarative tabular interface for managing multimodal data. In practice, Pixeltable replaces the complex multi-system architecture typically required for AI applications with a single tabular interface. This means you can manage images, videos, audio, and documents all together, without having to configure and maintain different separate systems.\nThink of Pixeltable as a large warehouse where all your data, regardless of format, are organized into tables. Each table can have columns of different types, such as images, videos, audio, and documents. You can define computed columns that perform transformations on the data, such as object detection in an image or audio transcription. All of this happens incrementally, meaning that every new data point added is automatically processed and added to the table without having to reprocess everything from scratch.\nWhy It\u0026rsquo;s Amazing # The \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; factor of Pixeltable lies in its ability to manage multimodal data in a declarative and incremental way. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a data management system; it\u0026rsquo;s a platform that allows you to focus on your application logic, letting Pixeltable handle the data management.\nDynamic and contextual: Pixeltable allows you to define computed columns that perform dynamic and contextual transformations on the data. For example, you can define a column that detects objects in an image using an object detection model. Every time you insert a new image, Pixeltable automatically performs object detection and updates the computed column. This means you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about reprocessing all the data every time you add a new item. As the Pixeltable team says: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m your system. Service X is offline, but I\u0026rsquo;ve already processed the data for you.\u0026rdquo;\nReal-time reasoning: Pixeltable supports integration with APIs like OpenAI Vision, allowing for real-time analysis. For example, you can define a computed column that uses the OpenAI API to describe the content of an image. Every time you insert a new image, Pixeltable automatically sends the request to the API and updates the column with the generated description. This is particularly useful for applications that require real-time analysis, such as fraud management or customer review monitoring.\nIntegration with machine learning models: Pixeltable supports integration with Hugging Face machine learning models, allowing for complex data transformations. For example, you can define a computed column that uses an object detection model to extract specific information from an image. Every time you insert a new image, Pixeltable automatically performs object detection and updates the column with the results. This is particularly useful for applications that require the analysis of large amounts of visual data, such as product recognition or inventory image management.\nHow to Try It # To get started with Pixeltable, follow these steps:\nInstallation: The first step is to install Pixeltable. You can do this easily using pip:\npip install pixeltable Make sure you also have the necessary dependencies, such as torch, transformers, and openai.\nBasic setup: Once installed, you can start creating tables with multimodal columns. Here is an example of how to create a table for images:\nimport pixeltable as pxt t = pxt.create_table(\u0026#39;images\u0026#39;, {\u0026#39;input_image\u0026#39;: pxt.Image}) This creates a table called images with a column of type Image.\nDefining computed columns: You can define computed columns that perform transformations on the data. For example, for object detection:\nfrom pixeltable.functions import huggingface t.add_computed_column( detections=huggingface.detr_for_object_detection( t.input_image, model_id=\u0026#39;facebook/detr-resnet-50\u0026#39; ) ) This adds a computed column that uses an object detection model to analyze the images.\nAPI integration: You can integrate APIs like OpenAI Vision to perform real-time analysis:\nfrom pixeltable.functions import openai t.add_computed_column( vision=openai.vision( prompt=\u0026#34;Describe what\u0026#39;s in this image.\u0026#34;, image=t.input_image, model=\u0026#39;gpt-4o-mini\u0026#39; ) ) This adds a computed column that uses the OpenAI API to describe the content of the images.\nData insertion: You can insert data directly from an external URL:\nt.insert(input_image=\u0026#39;https://raw.github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/release/docs/resources/images/000000000025.jpg\u0026#39;) This inserts an image into the table and automatically performs all defined transformations.\nDocumentation: For more details, consult the official documentation and application examples.\nFinal Thoughts # Pixeltable represents a significant step forward in the field of data infrastructure for multimodal AI applications. Its ability to manage different types of data in a declarative and incremental way makes it a powerful tool for developers and companies that need to tackle the complexity of multimodal data. With Pixeltable, you can focus on your application logic, letting the platform handle the data management.\nIn a world where data is increasingly varied and complex, Pixeltable offers a simple and effective solution for managing and analyzing multimodal data.

You need to extract useful information, such as customer opinions on various aspects of the product, but the dataset is too large to be managed manually. Or, imagine you are a machine learning engineer who needs to develop a chatbot system for an e-commerce company. The chatbot must be able to answer complex customer questions in real-time, but you have no idea where to start.\nThese are just two examples of situations where large language models (LLM) can make a difference. LLMs are artificial intelligence models that can understand and generate text in a way very similar to a human. However, working with these models can be complex and requires in-depth knowledge of various concepts and tools. This is where the \u0026ldquo;Hands-On Large Language Models\u0026rdquo; project comes into play.\nThis project, available on GitHub, is the official repository of the O\u0026rsquo;Reilly book \u0026ldquo;Hands-On Large Language Models.\u0026rdquo; It offers a practical and visually educational approach to learning how to use LLMs. With nearly 300 custom figures, the book and the repository guide you through the fundamental concepts and practical tools needed to work with LLMs today. Thanks to this project, you can transform complex data into useful information and create advanced artificial intelligence systems in a simple and intuitive way.\nWhat It Does # The \u0026ldquo;Hands-On Large Language Models\u0026rdquo; project is a repository that contains the code for all the examples in the eponymous book. The repository is structured into various chapters, each covering a specific topic related to LLMs. For example, there are chapters dedicated to the introduction to language models, tokens and embeddings, text classification, prompt engineering, and much more.\nThe project primarily uses Jupyter Notebook, an interactive development environment that allows you to run Python code and view the results in real-time. This makes the learning process much more interactive and accessible, especially for those new to the field of LLMs. Additionally, the repository includes detailed guides for installing and configuring the working environment, making it easy for anyone to start working with LLMs.\nWhy It\u0026rsquo;s Amazing # The \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; factor of this project lies in its ability to make complex concepts accessible through a practical and visually educational approach. It is not just a textbook or a code repository: it is a complete learning experience that guides you step-by-step into the world of LLMs.\nDynamic and contextual: # One of the most amazing aspects of this project is its dynamic and contextual nature. Each example in the repository is designed to be run in an interactive environment, such as Google Colab. This means you can immediately see the results of your code and understand how LLMs work in practice. For example, in the chapter dedicated to text classification, you can load your dataset of reviews and see how the model automatically classifies customer opinions. This approach makes learning much more engaging and effective.\nReal-time reasoning: # Another strength of the project is its ability to enable real-time reasoning. Thanks to the use of Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, you can run the code and see the results in real-time. This is particularly useful when working with large language models, which can be complex and difficult to understand. For example, you can load a pre-trained model and see how it responds to different questions in real-time. This allows you to experiment and better understand how LLMs work.\nConcrete examples and practical applications: # The project is rich in concrete examples and practical applications. Each chapter includes real examples that show you how to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems. For example, in the chapter dedicated to text generation, you can see how to create a chatbot that answers complex customer questions. Or, in the chapter dedicated to semantic search, you can see how to improve information retrieval in a dataset of documents. These concrete examples make the project much more useful and applicable to real life.\nCommunity and support: # Finally, the project benefits from an active community and continuous support. The authors of the book and the repository are actively involved in the community and respond to user questions and feedback. This makes the project much more reliable and supported, making it easier for anyone to start working with LLMs.\nHow to Try It # To start working with the \u0026ldquo;Hands-On Large Language Models\u0026rdquo; project, follow these steps:\nClone the repository: You can find the code on GitHub at the following address: Hands-On Large Language Models. Clone the repository to your computer using the command git clone https://github.com/HandsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models.git.\nPrerequisites: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Additionally, we recommend using Google Colab to run the notebooks, as it offers a free and powerful development environment with GPU access.\nSetup: Follow the instructions in the .setup/ folder to install all necessary dependencies. You can find a complete guide on how to configure the working environment in the .setup/conda/ folder.\nDocumentation: The main documentation is available in the repository and in the book \u0026ldquo;Hands-On Large Language Models.\u0026rdquo; We recommend reading the documentation carefully to better understand how to use the project.\nThere is no one-click demo, but the setup process is well-documented and easy to follow. Once the environment is configured, you can start exploring the various chapters and running the interactive examples.\nFinal Thoughts # The \u0026ldquo;Hands-On Large Language Models\u0026rdquo; project represents a significant step forward in how we can learn and work with large language models. Thanks to its practical and visually educational approach, it makes complex concepts accessible to a wider audience. This is particularly important in an era where artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly central in various sectors.\nThe project not only teaches you how to use LLMs but also shows you how to apply them to real-world problems. This makes it a valuable resource for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and anyone interested in exploring the potential of LLMs.\nIn conclusion, \u0026ldquo;Hands-On Large Language Models\u0026rdquo; is a project that has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and work with artificial intelligence.

Every day, your customers face complex and variable problems, such as fraudulent transactions, urgent technical issues, or specific information requests. Your goal is to create a system that not only answers questions but is also capable of learning and adapting in real-time, providing personalized and contextual solutions.\nIn this scenario, the 12-Factor Agents project comes into play. This framework, inspired by the principles of 12-Factor Apps, is designed to build applications based on Large Language Models (LLM) that are reliable and production-ready. With 12-Factor Agents, you can create intelligent agents that not only answer questions but are also capable of handling complex contexts and continuously learning, improving the quality of service offered to your customers.\nWhat It Does # 12-Factor Agents is a framework that allows you to build LLM-based applications following solid and well-defined principles. Think of it as a set of guidelines that help you create intelligent agents that are not only powerful but also reliable and scalable. The framework is written in TypeScript, a language that offers both the flexibility of JavaScript and the robustness of a typed language.\nThe main features of 12-Factor Agents include context management, request orchestration, prompt engineering, and memory management. These elements work together to create agents that can handle complex conversations, maintaining the context of previous interactions and adapting in real-time to users\u0026rsquo; needs. For example, an agent can remember a previous conversation and use that information to respond more accurately to a new question, thus improving the user experience.\nWhy It\u0026rsquo;s Amazing # The \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; factor of 12-Factor Agents lies in its ability to combine solid principles with unparalleled flexibility. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a framework that tells you what to do, but a set of guidelines that allow you to build applications that are truly intelligent and adaptable.\nDynamic and Contextual: # One of the strengths of 12-Factor Agents is context management. Agents created with this framework are able to maintain the context of conversations, remembering previous information and using it to respond more accurately. For example, if a customer has already discussed a specific technical problem, the agent can remember that conversation and use that information to resolve the issue more effectively. This makes interactions with the agent more natural and intuitive, improving the user experience.\nReal-time Reasoning: # Agents created with 12-Factor Agents are able to reason in real-time, adapting to users\u0026rsquo; needs and continuously learning. This means they can handle complex and variable situations, providing personalized and contextual solutions. For example, if a customer has an urgent request, the agent can use the available information to provide a quick and accurate response, improving customer satisfaction.\nAdvanced Orchestration: # Another advantage of 12-Factor Agents is its ability to orchestrate requests efficiently. Agents can handle multiple requests simultaneously, maintaining context and adapting in real-time. This makes the framework ideal for applications that require advanced request management, such as customer support systems or e-commerce platforms.\nPrompt Engineering: # The framework offers advanced tools for prompt engineering, allowing the creation of agents that can generate accurate and contextual responses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where responses need to be precise and personalized, such as in customer support systems or consulting platforms.\nHow to Try It # To get started with 12-Factor Agents, follow these steps:\nClone the repository: You can find the source code on GitHub at the following address: 12-Factor Agents GitHub. Clone the repository to your computer using the command git clone https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents.git.\nPrerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Additionally, you will need some specific dependencies that are listed in the package.json file.\nSetup: Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the command npm install. Follow the instructions in the main documentation to configure the development environment.\nDocumentation: The main documentation is available in the repository and provides all the necessary information to get started. There is no one-click demo, but the documentation is detailed and will guide you step by step.\nFinal Thoughts # 12-Factor Agents represents a significant step forward in the world of LLM-based applications. Positioning the project within the broader context of the tech ecosystem, we can see how this framework not only solves specific problems but also offers a scalable and reliable solution for developing intelligent agents. For the developer and tech enthusiast community, 12-Factor Agents is a valuable resource that can be used to create innovative and high-quality applications.\nIn conclusion, 12-Factor Agents has the potential to revolutionize the way we build LLM-based applications, offering tools and guidelines that allow the creation of intelligent and adaptable agents.

Ogni giorno, milioni di pazienti assumono farmaci, e monitorare gli effetti avversi è cruciale per garantire la loro sicurezza. Tuttavia, i dati provenienti dalle etichette dei farmaci e dalle prescrizioni sono spesso disorganizzati e difficili da interpretare. Questo è il contesto in cui entra in gioco MALADE, un sistema multi-agente progettato per estrarre e analizzare gli Eventi Avversi da Farmaci (ADE) in modo efficace e trasparente.\nMALADE, acronimo di Multi-Agent Architecture for Pharmacovigilance, è un innovativo strumento che sfrutta le potenzialità dei Large Language Models (LLM) per migliorare la farmacovigilanza. Questo sistema è il primo del suo genere a combinare agenti multi-agente con LLMs per estrarre informazioni cruciali dalle etichette dei farmaci e dai dati di prescrizione. In un\u0026rsquo;epoca in cui la sicurezza dei farmaci è più importante che mai, MALADE rappresenta un passo avanti significativo nella gestione e nell\u0026rsquo;analisi dei dati sanitari.\nDi Cosa Parla # MALADE è un sistema multi-agente che utilizza LLMs per estrarre informazioni sugli Eventi Avversi da Farmaci (ADE) dalle etichette dei farmaci e dai dati di prescrizione. Il sistema è progettato per essere agnostico rispetto al modello LLM utilizzato, il che significa che può funzionare con qualsiasi LLM disponibile. La sua architettura si basa sul framework Langroid, che combina agenti di Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) con agenti critici che forniscono feedback per migliorare continuamente le risposte.\nIl focus principale di MALADE è la farmacovigilanza, ovvero il monitoraggio e la valutazione della sicurezza dei farmaci. Il sistema è in grado di produrre una serie di output utili, tra cui una valutazione qualitativa del rischio (aumento, diminuzione o nessun effetto), la fiducia in questa valutazione, la frequenza dell\u0026rsquo;effetto, la forza delle prove e una giustificazione con citazioni. Questo rende MALADE uno strumento potente per i professionisti della salute che devono prendere decisioni informate basate su dati affidabili.\nPerché È Rilevante # Impatto sulla Sicurezza dei Pazienti # MALADE rappresenta un passo avanti significativo nella farmacovigilanza.

Ad esempio, MALADE può analizzare le etichette dei farmaci e i dati di prescrizione per identificare i farmaci rappresentativi all\u0026rsquo;interno di una categoria, aggregare le informazioni e fornire una valutazione completa del rischio.\nConformità alle Tendenze Attuali # MALADE si inserisce perfettamente nelle tendenze attuali del settore sanitario, che vedono un crescente interesse per l\u0026rsquo;uso di LLMs e sistemi multi-agente per migliorare la gestione dei dati sanitari. La capacità del sistema di fornire risposte trasparenti e giustificate con citazioni lo rende particolarmente prezioso in un\u0026rsquo;epoca in cui la trasparenza e la fiducia nei dati sanitari sono fondamentali.\nApplicazioni Pratiche # MALADE è uno strumento versatile che può essere utilizzato in vari contesti. Ad esempio, i professionisti della salute possono utilizzarlo per monitorare la sicurezza dei farmaci e identificare rapidamente gli effetti avversi. I ricercatori possono utilizzarlo per analizzare grandi quantità di dati sanitari e scoprire nuove correlazioni tra farmaci e esiti. Inoltre, MALADE può essere integrato in sistemi di gestione dei dati sanitari per migliorare l\u0026rsquo;efficienza e la precisione delle analisi.\nPer chi è interessato a esplorare ulteriormente le potenzialità di MALADE, è possibile consultare il repository GitHub del progetto, dove sono disponibili codici di esempio e documentazione dettagliata. Inoltre, il framework Langroid, su cui si basa MALADE, offre una serie di risorse e tutorial che possono aiutare a comprendere meglio il funzionamento del sistema e a implementarlo in contesti specifici.\nConsiderazioni Finali # MALADE rappresenta un passo avanti significativo nella farmacovigilanza, offrendo uno strumento potente e trasparente per l\u0026rsquo;estrazione e l\u0026rsquo;analisi degli Eventi Avversi da Farmaci.

Whatever work you do, if you transform what you are doing into art, you will probably discover that you have become an interesting person to others and not an object. This is because your decisions, made with Quality in mind, change you as well. Better yet: not only do they change you and the work, but they also change others, because Quality is like a wave. That Quality work you thought no one would notice is indeed noticed, and whoever sees it feels a little better: they will probably pass this feeling on to others, and in this way Quality will continue to spread. — Robert Pirsig We choose few projects and follow them with the utmost care.
